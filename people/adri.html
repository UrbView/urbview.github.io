        <h3 style="font-family: comic-sans">About me...</h3>

I was born in Tarragona, Catalonia (9 - 11- 2000). At a very young age I showed interest in science and technology. I'm also a musician. 
I always standed up for human and civil rights; with technology comes an oportunity on democratization of powerful tools for empowering citizens; 
In this matter I'm currently working as a researcher at Computer Vision Center (CVC) at Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, where I graduated as Data Engineering in 2022. I mainly work on AI technologies for historical heritage; I strongly belive that data can lead citizens to a better place; 
empowering their lives with tools based in factual information rather than opinions or biases from the developer. I will be working as associate profesor in the same university I studied.

On 2022 I participated on Citizens Hack, a hackathon organized by the EU, with my friend Gerard. I met my wonderful partner Elnaz. A month later we were working on making our idea from the hackathon an actual thing, where we started to work along Franzi.
We're currently pushing forward our idea as "UrbView" with really great hopes and expectations
